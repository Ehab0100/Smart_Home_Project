# Smart_Home_Project
🏡 Our system incorporated various functionalities to enhance home automation and security. One of the key features was the user-friendly interface that allowed users to enter a password for accessing the system.
In case of multiple failed login attempts, the system implemented a temporary block state and activated a buzzer alarm as an added security measure. 🚨

💡 The heart of our smart home system was the integration of different components and peripherals. The LCD display provided users with convenient options to control the door, rooms, and fan. 🖥️
Door Opening: The first microcontroller is responsible for controlling the door's opening and closing mechanism. It utilizes a servo motor to physically indicate the door's movements. When the correct password is entered, the servo motor rotates to simulate the door opening. 🚪🔒

💡 Speaking of rooms, our system offered control over the lights ,fans and An air conditioning in two different rooms and bathroom.

🌀 The fan functionality was equally versatile, with manual mode. users could adjust its speed level, The fan has 3 speed levels. 💨💨

 🌀An air conditioning control mechanism:
- We have integrated a temperature sensor that monitors the surrounding temperature. Based on temperature readings, our system can activate an air conditioning.

🔧 We made sure to design a flexible and customizable system, allowing each room to be individually configured. This provides users with tailored control over their smart home environment. 🏠🌟
